![Password Generator](./pictures/generate-password.png)
***This is the html and css webpage that I started with to create this generator

![First Prompt](./pictures/how-many.png)
The first prompt you see after hitting the button asks how many characters long your password will be.

![Asking if this password will have uppercase letters](./pictures/confirm.png)
![Asking if the this password will have special characters](./pictures/prompt-cancel.png)
These two images show the prompts asked after giving the password length. The user said 'confirm' for thr first one and 'cancel for the second.

![The final password](./pictures/password-generated.png)
This is the final result of the prompts. It is 9 characters long, includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and no special characters.
